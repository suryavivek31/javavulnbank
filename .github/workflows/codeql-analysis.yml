To refactor the given code for code cleanup, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary comments: Remove the comments that are not providing any useful information for the code.

2. Remove unused permissions: Remove the permissions that are not required for the code analysis.

3. Remove unnecessary language matrix: Since the code is written in ReactJS, we can remove the language matrix and set the language to 'javascript' directly.

4. Update the job name: Update the job name to reflect the purpose of the job, such as "CodeQL Analysis".

5. Remove unnecessary steps: Remove the steps related to autobuild and custom queries as they are not required for code cleanup.

6. Update the schedule: Update the schedule to a more appropriate time for running the code analysis.

Here is the refactored code:

```javascript
name: "CodeQL Analysis"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: CodeQL Analysis
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: 'javascript'

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

Please note that this refactoring is focused on code cleanup. If you have any specific requirements or additional changes, please let me know.
